# Managing Helm releases the GitOps way

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanprodan/gitops-helm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanprodan/gitops-helm)

**What is GitOps?**

GitOps is a way to do Continuous Delivery, it works by using Git as a source of truth for declarative infrastructure and workloads. 
For Kubernetes this means using `git push` instead of `kubectl create/apply` or `helm install/upgrade`.

In a traditional CICD pipeline, CD is an implementation extension powered by the 
continuous integration tooling to promote build artifacts to production. 
In the GitOps pipeline model, any change to production must be committed in source control 
(preferable via a pull request) prior to being applied on the cluster. 
This way rollback and audit logs are provided by Git. 
If the entire production state is under version control and described in a single Git repository, when disaster strikes, 
the whole infrastructure can be quickly restored from that repository.

To better understand the benefits of this approach to CD and what the differences between GitOps and 
Infrastructure-as-Code tools are, head to the Weaveworks website and read [GitOps - What you need to know](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) article.

In order to apply the GitOps pipeline model to Kubernetes you need three things: 

* a Git repository with your workloads definitions in YAML format, Helm charts and any other Kubernetes custom resource that defines your cluster desired state (I will refer to this as the *config* repository)
* a container registry where your CI system pushes immutable images (no *latest* tags, use *semantic versioning* or git *commit sha*)
* an operator that runs in your cluster and does a two-way synchronization:
    * watches the registry for new image releases and based on deployment policies updates the workload definitions with the new image tag and commits the changes to the config repository 
    * watches for changes in the config repository and applies them to your cluster

I will be using GitHub to host the config repo, Docker Hub as the container registry and Weave Flux OSS as the GitOps Kubernetes Operator.

### Install Helm and Tiller

If you don't have Helm CLI installed, on macOS you can use `brew install kubernetes-helm`.   

Create a service account and a cluster role binding for Tiller: 

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system create sa tiller

kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule \
    --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
    --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller 
```

Note that on GKE you need to create an admin cluster user for yourself:

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding "cluster-admin-$(whoami)" \
    --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
    --user="$(gcloud config get-value core/account)"
```

Deploy Tiller in kube-system namespace:

```bash
helm init --skip-refresh --upgrade --service-account tiller
```

### Install Weave Flux

The first step in automating Helm releases with [Weave Flux](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux) is to create a Git repository with your charts source code.
You can fork the [gitops-helm](https://github.com/stefanprodan/gitops-helm) project and use it as a template for your cluster config.

*If you fork, update the release definitions with your docker hub repository located in \releases\(dev/stg/prod)\podinfo.yaml in your master branch before proceeding.

Add the Weave Flux chart repo:

```bash
helm repo add weaveworks https://weaveworks.github.io/flux
```

Install Weave Flux and its Helm Operator by specifying your fork URL 
(replace `stefanprodan` with your GitHub username): 

```bash
helm install --name flux \
--set rbac.create=true \
--set helmOperator.create=true \
--set git.url=ssh://git@github.com/stefanprodan/gitops-helm \
--namespace flux \
weaveworks/flux
```

The Flux Helm operator provides an extension to Weave Flux that automates Helm Chart releases for it. 
A Chart release is described through a Kubernetes custom resource named FluxHelmRelease. 
The Flux daemon synchronizes these resources from git to the cluster, 
and the Flux Helm operator makes sure Helm charts are released as specified in the resources.

Note that Flux Helm Operator works with Kubernetes 1.9 or newer. 

At startup Flux generates a SSH key and logs the public key. 
Find the SSH public key with:

```bash
kubectl -n flux logs deployment/flux | grep identity.pub | cut -d '"' -f2
```

In order to sync your cluster state with Git you need to copy the public key and 
create a **deploy key** with **write access** on your GitHub repository.

Open GitHub, navigate to your fork, go to _Setting > Deploy keys_ click on _Add deploy key_, check 
_Allow write access_, paste the Flux public key and click _Add key_.

### GitOps pipeline example

The config repo has the following structure:

```
├── charts
│   └── podinfo
│       ├── Chart.yaml
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── templates
│       └── values.yaml
├── hack
│   ├── Dockerfile.ci
│   └── ci-mock.sh
├── namespaces
│   ├── dev.yaml
│   └── stg.yaml
└── releases
    ├── dev
    │   └── podinfo.yaml
    └── stg
        └── podinfo.yaml
```

I will be using [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/k8s-podinfo) to demonstrate a full CI/CD pipeline including promoting releases between environments.  

I'm assuming the following Git branching model:
* dev branch (feature-ready state)
* stg branch (release-candidate state)
* master branch (production-ready state)

When a PR is merged in the dev or stg branch will produce a immutable container image as in `repo/app:branch-commitsha`.

Inside the *hack* dir you can find a script that simulates the CI process for dev and stg. 
The *ci-mock.sh* script does the following:
* pulls the podinfo source code from GitHub
* generates a random string and modifies the code
* generates a random Git commit short SHA
* builds a Docker image with the format: `yourname/podinfo:branch-sha`
* pushes the image to Docker Hub

Let's create an image corresponding to the `dev` branch (replace `stefanprodan` with your Docker Hub username):

```
$ cd hack && ./ci-mock.sh -r stefanprodan/podinfo -b dev

Sending build context to Docker daemon  4.096kB
Step 1/15 : FROM golang:1.10 as builder
....
Step 9/15 : FROM alpine:3.7
....
Step 12/15 : COPY --from=builder /go/src/github.com/stefanprodan/k8s-podinfo/podinfo .
....
Step 15/15 : CMD ["./podinfo"]
....
Successfully built 71bee4549fb2
Successfully tagged stefanprodan/podinfo:dev-kb9lm91e
The push refers to repository [docker.io/stefanprodan/podinfo]
36ced78d2ca2: Pushed 
```

Inside the *charts* directory there is a podinfo Helm chart. 
Using this chart I want to create a release in the `dev` namespace with the image I've just published to Docker Hub.
Instead of editing the `values.yaml` from the chart source, I create a `FluxHelmRelease` definition (located in /releases/dev/podinfo.yaml): 

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.integrations.flux.weave.works/v1alpha2
kind: FluxHelmRelease
metadata:
  name: podinfo-dev
  namespace: dev
  annotations:
    flux.weave.works/automated: "true"
    flux.weave.works/tag.chart-image: glob:dev-*
spec:
  chartGitPath: podinfo
  releaseName: podinfo-dev
  values:
    image: stefanprodan/podinfo:dev-kb9lm91e
    replicaCount: 1
```

Flux Helm release fields:

* `metadata.name` is mandatory and needs to follow Kubernetes naming conventions
* `metadata.namespace` is optional and determines where the release is created
* `spec.releaseName` is optional and if not provided the release name will be $namespace-$name
* `spec.chartGitPath` is the directory containing the chart, given relative to the charts path
* `spec.values` are user customizations of default parameter values from the chart itself

The options specified in the FluxHelmRelease `spec.values` will override the ones in `values.yaml` from the chart source. 

With the `flux.weave.works` annotations I instruct Flux to automate this release.
When a new tag with the prefix `dev` is pushed to Docker Hub, Flux will update the image field in the yaml file, 
will commit and push the change to Git and finally will apply the change on the cluster. 

![gitops-automation](https://github.com/stefanprodan/openfaas-flux/blob/master/docs/screens/flux-helm-image-update.png)

When the `podinfo-dev` FluxHelmRelease object changes inside the cluster, 
Kubernetes API will notify the Flux Helm Operator and the operator will perform a Helm release upgrade. 

```
$ helm history podinfo-dev

REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS    	CHART        	DESCRIPTION     
1       	Fri Jul 20 16:51:52 2018	SUPERSEDED	podinfo-0.2.0	Install complete
2       	Fri Jul 20 22:18:46 2018	DEPLOYED  	podinfo-0.2.0	Upgrade complete
```

The Flux Helm Operator reacts to changes in the FluxHelmResources collection but will also detect changes in the charts source files.
If I make a change to the podinfo chart, the operator will pick that up and run an upgrade. 

![gitops-chart-change](https://github.com/stefanprodan/openfaas-flux/blob/master/docs/screens/flux-helm-chart-update.png)

```
$ helm history podinfo-dev

REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS    	CHART        	DESCRIPTION     
1       	Fri Jul 20 16:51:52 2018	SUPERSEDED	podinfo-0.2.0	Install complete
2       	Fri Jul 20 22:18:46 2018	SUPERSEDED	podinfo-0.2.0	Upgrade complete
3       	Fri Jul 20 22:39:39 2018	DEPLOYED  	podinfo-0.2.1	Upgrade complete
```

Now let's assume that I want to promote the code from the `dev` branch into a more stable environment for others to test it. 
I would create a release candidate by merging the podinfo code from `dev` into the `stg` branch. 
The CI would kick in and publish a new image:

```bash
$ cd hack && ./ci-mock.sh -r stefanprodan/podinfo -b stg

Successfully tagged stefanprodan/podinfo:stg-9ij63o4c
The push refers to repository [docker.io/stefanprodan/podinfo]
8f21c3669055: Pushed 
```

Assuming the staging environment has some sort of automated load testing in place, 
I want to have a different configuration than dev: 

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.integrations.flux.weave.works/v1alpha2
kind: FluxHelmRelease
metadata:
  name: podinfo-rc
  namespace: stg
  annotations:
    flux.weave.works/automated: "true"
    flux.weave.works/tag.chart-image: glob:stg-*
spec:
  chartGitPath: podinfo
  releaseName: podinfo-rc
  values:
    image: stefanprodan/podinfo:stg-9ij63o4c
    replicaCount: 2
    hpa:
      enabled: true
      maxReplicas: 10
      cpu: 50
      memory: 128Mi
```

With Flux Helm releases it's easy to manage different configurations per environment. 
When adding a new option in the chart source make sure it's turned off by default so it will not affect all environments.

If I want to create a new environment, let's say for hotfixes testing, I would do the following:
* create a new namespace definition in `namespaces/hotfix.yaml`
* create a dir `releases/hotfix`
* create a FluxHelmRelease named `podinfo-hotfix`
* set the automation filter to `glob:hotfix-*`
* make the CI tooling publish images from my hotfix branch to `stefanprodan/podinfo:hotfix-sha`

### Production promotions with sem ver

For production, instead of tagging the images with the Git commit, I will use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

Let's assume that I want to promote the code from the `stg` branch into `master` and do a production release. 
After merging `stg` into `master` via a pull request, I would cut a release by tagging `master` with version `0.4.10`.

When I push the git tag, the CI will publish a new image in the `repo/app:git_tag` format:

```bash
$ cd hack && ./ci-mock.sh -r stefanprodan/podinfo -v 0.4.10

Successfully built f176482168f8
Successfully tagged stefanprodan/podinfo:0.4.10
``` 

If I want to automate the production deployment based on version tags, I would use `semver` filters instead of `glob`:

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.integrations.flux.weave.works/v1alpha2
kind: FluxHelmRelease
metadata:
  name: podinfo-prod
  namespace: prod
  annotations:
    flux.weave.works/automated: "true"
    flux.weave.works/tag.chart-image: semver:~0.4
spec:
  chartGitPath: podinfo
  releaseName: podinfo-prod
  values:
    image: stefanprodan/podinfo:0.4.10
    replicaCount: 3
```

Now if I release a new patch, let's say `0.4.11`, Flux will automatically deploy it.

```bash
$ cd hack && ./ci-mock.sh -r stefanprodan/podinfo -v 0.4.11

Successfully tagged stefanprodan/podinfo:0.4.11
```

### Managing Kubernetes secrets

In order to store secrets safely in a public Git repo you can use the Bitnami [Sealed Secrets controller](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) 
and encrypt your Kubernetes Secrets into SealedSecrets. 
The SealedSecret can be decrypted only by the controller running in your cluster.

This is the sealed-secrets controller release:

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.integrations.flux.weave.works/v1alpha2
kind: FluxHelmRelease
metadata:
  name: sealed-secrets
  namespace: adm
spec:
  chartGitPath: sealed-secrets
  releaseName: sealed-secrets
  values:
    image: quay.io/bitnami/sealed-secrets-controller:v0.7.0
```

Note that this release is not automated, since this is a critical component I prefer to update it manually. 

Install the kubeseal CLI:

```bash
wget https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.7.0/kubeseal-darwin-amd64
sudo install -m 755 kubeseal-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kubeseal
```

At startup, the sealed-secrets controller generates a RSA key and logs the public key. 
Using kubeseal you can save your public key as `pub-cert.pem`, 
the public key can be safely stored in Git, and can be used to encrypt secrets without direct access to the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubeseal --fetch-cert \
--controller-namespace=adm \
--controller-name=sealed-secrets \
> pub-cert.pem
```

You can generate a Kubernetes secret locally with kubectl and encrypt it with kubeseal:

```bash
kubectl -n dev create secret generic basic-auth \
--from-literal=user=admin \
--from-literal=password=admin \
--dry-run \
-o json > basic-auth.json

kubeseal --format=yaml --cert=pub-cert.pem < basic-auth.json > basic-auth.yaml
```

This generates a custom resource of type `SealedSecret` that contains the encrypted credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  name: basic-auth
  namespace: adm
spec:
  encryptedData:
    password: AgAR5nzhX2TkJ.......
    user: AgAQDO58WniIV3gTk.......
``` 

Delete the `basic-auth.json` file and push the `pub-cert.pem` and `basic-auth.yaml` to Git:

```bash
rm basic-auth.json
mv basic-auth.yaml /releases/dev/

git commit -a -m "Add basic auth credentials to dev namespace" && git push
```

Flux will apply the sealed secret on your cluster and sealed-secrets controller will then decrypt it into a 
Kubernetes secret. 

![SealedSecrets](https://github.com/stefanprodan/openfaas-flux/blob/master/docs/screens/flux-secrets.png)

To prepare for disaster recovery you should backup the sealed-secrets controller private key with:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n adm sealed-secrets-key -o yaml --export > sealed-secrets-key.yaml
```

To restore from backup after a disaster, replace the newly-created secret and restart the controller:

```bash
kubectl replace secret -n adm sealed-secrets-key -f sealed-secrets-key.yaml
kubectl delete pod -n adm -l app=sealed-secrets
```

### Flux Helm Integration FAQ

**My Helm charts have more than one container image. How can I automate the image tag update for all my containers?**

A container image list must have the following format:

```yaml
container_name_1:
  image: repo/app1:tag
container_name_2:
  image: quay.io/repo/app2:tag
```

Here is an example with different deployment automation policies:

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.integrations.flux.weave.works/v1alpha2
kind: FluxHelmRelease
metadata:
  name: openfaas
  namespace: openfaas
  annotations:
    flux.weave.works/automated: "true"
    flux.weave.works/tag.prometheus: glob:v2.3.*
    flux.weave.works/tag.alertmanager: glob:v0.*.*
    flux.weave.works/tag.nats: glob:*.*.*
spec:
  chartGitPath: openfaas
  releaseName: openfaas
  values:
    gateway:
      image: openfaas/gateway:0.8.5
    operator:
      image: openfaas/openfaas-operator:0.8.0
    queueWorker:
      image: openfaas/queue-worker:0.4.4-rc1
    prometheus:
      image: prom/prometheus:v2.3.1
    alertmanager:
      image: prom/alertmanager:v0.15.0
    nats:
      image: nats-streaming:0.6.0
```

**I'm using SSL between Helm and Tiller. How can I configure Flux to use the certificate?**

When installing Flux, you can supply the CA and client-side certificate using the `helmOperator.tls` options, more details [here](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/blob/master/chart/flux/README.md#installing-weave-flux-helm-operator-and-helm-with-tls-enabled).  

**I've deleted a `FluxHelmRelease` file from Git. Why is the Helm release still running on my cluster?**

Flux doesn't delete resources, there is an [issue](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/738) opened about this topic on GitHub. 
In order to delete a Helm release first remove the file from Git and afterwards run:

```yaml
kubectl -n dev delete fluxhelmrelease/podinfo-dev
```

The Flux Helm operator will receive the delete event and will purge the Helm release.

**I've uninstalled Flux and all my Helm releases are gone. Why is that?**

On `FluxHelmRelease` CRD deletion, Kubernetes will remove all `FluxHelmRelease` CRs triggering a Helm purge for each release created by Flux.
To avoid this you have to manually delete the Flux Helm Operator with `kubectl -n flux delete deployment/flux-helm-operator` before running `helm delete flux`.

**I have a dedicated Kubernetes cluster per environment and I want to use the same Git repo for all. How can I do that?**

For each cluster create a Git branch in your config repo. When installing Flux set the Git branch using `--set git.branch=cluster-name`.

**How can I monitor the CD pipeline and the workloads managed by Flux?**

[Weave Cloud](https://www.weave.works/product/cloud/) is a SaaS product by Weaveworks that extends Flux with:

* a UI for all Flux operations, audit trail and alerts for deployments
* a realtime map of your cluster to debug and analyse its state
* full observability and insights into your cluster (hosted Prometheus with 13 months of metrics history)
* instant Flux operations via GitHub webhooks routing
